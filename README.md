## Features

- **Visualization of Algorithms:** Explore algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Prim, and more.
- **Interactive Interface:** Add, remove, and modify nodes and edges on the canvas with support for weighted and unweighted graphs.
- **Color-Coded Visualizations:** Nodes and edges are color-coded to indicate processing stages and results for better understanding.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Customize visualization speed to suit your learning pace.
- **Intuitive User Experience:** Enhance your understanding of complex algorithms through an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
